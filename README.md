Interactive application that visualizes sorting algorithms on a 2D array using OpenGL and C++. This tool provides real-time graphical representations of sorting processes, aiding in the understanding of algorithm behavior and performance.

### Pending Tasks
- Build system for different platforms instead of a single VS solution.
- Implement other sorting algorithms
